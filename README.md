# Scalapay Order

This runs the front end to the Scalapay developer assignment.
The frontend relies on the NodeJS backend being served on 127.0.0.1:3000

## Development server
Run `npm install`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
If you do not have `ng` on the global namespace you can run `npm start`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` or `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
